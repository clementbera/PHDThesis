\chapter{Making runtime information available to frameworks}
\label{chap:exploitation}
\minitoc

Paper: Opal + runtime type inference * 2
small intro

use VM info for other purpose

\section{Making VM info available in the AST}

\subsection{Smalltalk debugging infrastructure}

both old and new

Explain debugging infra in smalltalk with ast based highlighting.

Existing compiler was based on bc -> source range mapping.

We changed to bc to ast to source range

can ask any bcpc for its corresponding AST node.

Maybe I should talk here again about mcpc to bcpc mapping ???

\subsection{Leveraging information from bytecode to AST: the example of send and branch data}

That could be use to leverage information from bc to AST.

reuse debug infrastructure because AST based

Doc: Opal paper.

subsection: debugging
subsection: sendAndBranchData 

sendAndBranchData pc -> types

can just annotate the sendNode.

+ branch data

\section{Use-case: Runtime type inference}

Doc: Nevena paper

just write things from there. multiple subsection I guess

\section{VM info and VM evolution}

discussion once adaptive opt what needs to be kept.

=> problem of VM evolution and changing information

\section{Related work ???}
-- other use of architecture ? Seemingly proto ruby truffle ? Need to look into review IWST. Things exists for profiling (energy or time consumption or ...) but not really types ?

Not sure about that last section
