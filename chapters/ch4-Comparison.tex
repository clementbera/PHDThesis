\section{Language - virtual machine interface}

intro with C++ and nothing like we have for context, runtime optimizer

\subsection{Truffle runtime}
In truffle same runtime, similar to us, but different interface. deopt in C++. 


\subsection{Pypy runtime}
I believe it's like slang ? More complete with CPython. Similar to slang.

\subsection{Other metacircular runtimes}

=> focus on no interface with Metacircular VM
different because cut at different places (lower or higher level ?)
Discuss Klein, Maxine, Jikes

\section{Cross-start-up persistance}

\subsection{Optimisations}
Note: title should be the same (no ing and not ing.)

-- persisting opt see paper related / process, we don't know anybody doing that
--> arch paper for persisting opt. Comp to Truffle to do. (Thread, same runtime, interface different)

\subsection{Processes}

Nobody does that.
