\chapter{The Sista Architecture}
\label{chap:archTheory}
\minitoc

Paper: sista arch
small intro. 

\section{General approach}

optimization process, deoptimization process in a nutshell.

the recursive problem

Doc: blog post Sista chronicles 1, an update on the sista, talks at ESUG and Smalltalks + arch paper

\section{The VM interface}

bytecode, primitive, call-backs

Doc: bytecode paper + arch paper

\section{Pros and cons}
=> optimizer capabilities and limitations
=> advantages and disadvantages
-- persisting opt across start-up 
-- low engineering cost ?
-- ST problem, save process across start-up
-- sharing the VM info for other purpose
disadvantages
-- opt info lost, waste time going to bc, etc.
-- problem of having it in the language: hard to keep the programmer unaware
-- new opt may be difficult if need to extend too much the interface, it has to be small
