In this Chapter we summarize this dissertation. We list the contributions, the published papers and their impact.

\section{Summary}

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:stateOfTheArt}} defined the terminology used in the Ph.D. The Chapter then described the two most common architectures for optimising JITs, with examples of VM using one architecture or the other. Then, related work to metacircular VMs and the persistence of the runtime state across start-ups were listed.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:existing}} detailled the existing Pharo runtime. The focus was on the features not present in most other VMs or relevant in the context of the dissertation. Sista is built on top of the existing runtime described in this Chapter.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:architecture}} explained Sista, including the inner details of the architecture. Especially, the split between Scorch and Cogit in the optimising JIT architecture was described. The Chapter compared Sista against existing architectures for optimising JITs.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:runtimeEvolution}} discussed the evolutions required to the existing Pharo runtime to implement the Sista architecture on top of the existing runtime. This included all the core aspects of the system which needed to be changed to support Sista, such as the implementation of closures or the ability to mark an object as read-only.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:metacircular}} was articulated around a problem happening in metacircular optimising JIT such as Scorch: Scorch may end up in an infinite recursion, calling itself repeatedly and slowing down code execution drastically. The problem happens both during function optimisation and frame deoptimisation. The problem is solved by disabling the optimiser in specific circumstances and by making the deoptimisation code completely independent from the rest of the system.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:persistence}} detailled how the runtime state is persisted across multiple start-ups in the context of Sista, including optimised v-functions, allowing to decrease warm-up time. 

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:validation}} showed benchmarks run on the existing Pharo runtime and the Sista runtime. The Sista VM is 1.5x to 5x faster at peak performance than the current production runtime and peak performance is reached almost immediately after start-up if optimised v-functions are persisted as part of the snapshot.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{chap:futureWork}} discussed future work that may be interesting based on the contents of this thesis.

\section{Contributions}

The main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The implementation of Sista, which yields 1.5x to 5x speed-up in execution time compared to the existing Pharo runtime and allow to reach peak performance very quickly if optimised v-functions are persisted from previous runs of the VM.
	\item An alternative bytecode set solving multiple existing encoding limitations.
	\item A language extension: each object can now be marked as read-only.
	\item An alternative implementation of closures, both allowing simplifications in existing code and enabling new optimisation possibilities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Impact of the thesis}

Multiple contributions of the thesis (the alternative bytecode set, the read-only objects and the alternative implementation of closures) are integrated and interested the user-base of Pharo. The main impact is Sista, which is currently being integrated in Pharo and will hopefully enable new research and industrial work to be done with Pharo.
