intro architecture versus problems

\section{Infinite recursion in metacircular virtual machine}

Doc: blog post Sista chronicles 1, an update on the sista, talks at ESUG and Smalltalks + arch paper

same runtime versus compiled runtime. Compare with Pypy, Graal. Modification at runtime of the optimiser in our case (Smalltalk + same runtime).
Both optimiser deoptimiser. => constraint
optimiser => disable it while running, each dependency becomes bilateral hence modifying dependency crash the VM
deoptimiser => can't disable it while running. Attempt to recovery state with limited portion that cannot be optimised, issues with green threads and complexity, made it independent.
Example of debugging -> can't log from deoptimiser or dependencies
