\chapter{Existing and related runtime environment}
\label{chap:comparison}
\minitoc

\section{High-performance production virtual machines}

\subsection{Existing C++ runtimes}
-- Existing C++ runtimes and why C++ blabla
talk about java and Javascript and maybe CLR.

\subsection{Smalltalk production virtual machines}

\section{Interface between the VM and the runtime}

\subsection{Truffle runtime}
In truffle same runtime, similar to us, but different interface. deopt in C++.  

\subsection{Pypy runtime}
I believe it's like slang ? More complete with CPython

\subsection{Other metacircular runtimes}

=> focus on no interface with Metacircular VM
different because cut at different places (lower or higher level ?)
Discuss Klein, Maxine, Jikes

\section{Cross-start-up persistance}

\subsection{optimisations}
Note: title should be the same (no ing and not ing.)

-- persisting opt see paper related / process, we don't know anybody doing that
--> arch paper for persisting opt. Comp to Truffle to do. (Thread, same runtime, interface different)

\subsection{processes}
