\chapter{The Sista Architecture}
\label{chap:archTheory}
\minitoc

Paper: sista arch
small intro. 

\section{General approach}

explain first the system: snapshot, runtime objects available and stack reification.

stack reification we explain later (quote chapter and section) 

\subsection {Overview}

split architecture, what is where. 

in theory, optimised bc method could be interpreted. In practice it does not really make sense. But in some cases it does.

\subsection {Optimisation process}



\subsection {Deoptimisation process}

optimization process, deoptimization process in a nutshell.

\subsection{Recursion problem}

the recursive problem

Doc: blog post Sista chronicles 1, an update on the sista, talks at ESUG and Smalltalks + arch paper

\section{Virtual Machine interface extension}

\subsection{Runtime information access}

both branch and send data

\subsection{New call-backs}

\subsection{New unsafe instructions}

description of new instructions

Doc: bytecode paper + arch paper

\section{Advantages}

\subsection{Persistance through snapshots}

optimization and processes

\subsection{Runtime information available}

is it good ? May change

\subsection{High-level language and engineering cost}

start with efficiency ratio from known books.

why it is not really high level language.

they conclude that we believe (but maybe not) that we are more efficient. Maybe other solution better like DSL

\subsection{Modification at runtime}

disable, change, re-enable, etc.
Or is it the same as engineering cost.

\section{Issues}

\subsection{Towards highest performance}
-- opt info lost, waste time going to bc, etc.

\subsection{High-level virtual machine and programmer awareness}
-- problem of having it in the language: hard to keep the programmer unaware

\subsection{New optimizations}
-- new opt may be difficult if need to extend too much the interface, it has to be small
Up until now it's fine.
